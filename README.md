> A simple frontend UI to book rooms built using garden component, react, typescript with TDD

# Functional Requirements
- Up to eight rooms can be added
- Each room has at least one adult and up to a maximum of five
- Each room has zero or more children up to a maximum of three
- Each child needs to have their age supplied, so we know what kind of bed or cot to provide and what to charge for the room
- Each room has a maximum occupancy of five. This is, adults plus children per room
- The Guest and Room selector should always yield a valid room occupancy, use button disablement to avoid invalid configurations
- A user can either click Search to commit the output to the URL or click the x on top to reset the chosen room selection and revert the UI back to the original state.

## Input rules
The component should be able to pass a string as the default data. These are the rules:

- Rooms are separated by pipe |
- Adults and children are separated by a colon :
- Children ages are separated by a comma ,

### Examples:

- "1:4,6|3" ‚Üí Two rooms, one with one adult and two children ages four and six and the other with three adults and no children
- "3" ‚Üí One room with three adults and no children
- "2:4" ‚Üí One room with two adults and one child aged four
- "1:0,13,16" ‚Üí One room with one adult and three children (aged zero, thirteen, and sixteen)
